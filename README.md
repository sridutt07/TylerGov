# Tyler Assessment Implementation  

### This is done on the microsoft stack:- <br>
1. UI - Angular 15 <br>
2. API - .Net Core Entity Framework <br>
3. DB - SQL Server (I am developing on a Mac , I have created a docker container to host the SQL Server and used Azure Studio instead of SSMS) <br>

### Assumptions that I have made:<br>
1. A employee of role director is a manager in the create employee view.
2. The DB design allows for scalability even though it may not be applicable in this case.
3. Not implemented test-cases as it is out of scope.
